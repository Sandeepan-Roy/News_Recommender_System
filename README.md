iPrint is an upcoming media house in India that offers media and information services to the people. The companyâ€™s business extends across a wide range of media, including news and information services on sports, weather, education, health, research, stocks and healthcare. Over the years, through its online application, iPrint has been efficiently delivering news and information to the common people. However, with time and technological advancements, several new competitors of iPrint have emerged in the market. Hence, it has decided to begin providing a more personalised experience to its customers.

The problem statement can be divided into two parts.

Recommend new top 10 relevant articles to a user when he visits the app at the start of the day
Recommend top 10 similar news articles that match the ones clicked by the user.
You have to ensure that the system does not recommend any news article that has been pulled out from the app or has already been seen by the user. In addition, only the articles that are written in the English language must be considered for content-based recommendations. The final generated list must contain the names of the recommended articles, along with their IDs.
